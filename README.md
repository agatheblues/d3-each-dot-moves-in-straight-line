# d3-each-dot-moves-in-straight-line
Each circle moves in a straight line in a circle animation !

# The circles
They are moving on lines with a sin-in-out transition. By using the proper delay, the overall movement of all the circles looks like... a circle! 

# The curve
The curve on the right shows the transition function applied to the circles. It's synced with the blue circle (no delay).

# The slider
You can change the number of circles by moving the slider from 1 to 50.

# How does it look ?
